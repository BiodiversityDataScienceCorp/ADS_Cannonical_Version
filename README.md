## Applied Data Science (ADS) Course
This class is a structured practicum with the goal of supporting students to build knowledge and skills relevant to applying data science to issues of species conservation. The class is a collaboration between students at the University of Arizona and Lewis & Clark College. We will work together with professionals at the US Fish & Wildlife Service who are on the front lines of managing endangered species. Students work in teams to organize, clean, analyze and visualize data to help improve conservation approaches and management efforts for species of concern in the US. In this process students are introduced to the realities of conservation jobs in governmental and nonprofit organizations and help you build professional skills that are relevant in these fields. Students also learn more about data science in general and project management best practices of working as a team.

## GitHub Pages Website
Our course has a [website](https://biodiversitydatasciencecorp.github.io/ADS_Cannonical_Version/home.html) where the course materials are organized and can be shared. The published website includes course details, like the weekly schedule and copies of all assignments, lessons, and readings. The files for a given lesson can be downloaded directly from the website or downloaded from this repository. 

This website is intended to be customizable for other instructors to copy and modify for their class needs. 

## GitHub Repository
This repository contains all of the .qmd and .rmd files necessary to run the course, as well as all of the website-related documents.
