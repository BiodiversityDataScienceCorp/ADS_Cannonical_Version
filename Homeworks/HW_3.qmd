**Note: It is critical you do these steps in the exact order outlined below.**

\

**Getting your group repository onto your posit cloud**

\

1.  Log in to your personal GitHub account

2.  Navigate to our class\' organization, [BiodiversityDataScienceCorp](https://github.com/orgs/BiodiversityDataScienceCorp/repositories)

3.  Find the repository that has your group name on it

4.  Click the green code button and copy the link there

5.  Log in to your posit cloud account

6.  Create a new project: new project from Git Repository

7.  Paste the link you copied from GitHub when prompted

\

You now should have a project in posit.cloud that is your local copy of your group\'s repository. This project should already be populated with a gitignore, license, and README file. There should be a Git tab in the top right corner of R studio.

\

**Setting up your group repository for commits/pushes/pulls**

1.  In this new project in rstudio cloud, add a line in the gitignore file that says \"github.R\"

2.  Create a new .R file and name it \"github.R\"

3.  Copy the contents from the github.R file you have in the project you created during class

4.  Paste them to the new github.R file in your group repository. Save it. Highlight all of the code and run it. 

\

You now should be able to commit/push/pull to/from GitHub to work collaboratively with your group. 

\

**To work collaboratively with GitHub / R studio, follow this flow**

**\*Only one person edits the same file at a time.** If two people edit the same document simultaneously, you will have to do extra work to ensure all of your saves are committed properly. 

**\*Multiple people can work at once on different files**. For example, Person A can edit your README while Person B edits your gitignore. 

1.  Person A: Write some code in a file and click save when you are done

2.  Person A: Commit and push the code. Leave a detailed commit message for your future self if you ever need to go back to a previous version. Be sure to push. 

3.  Person B: Pull first!!! 

4.  Person B: Edit the file. Save. Commit. Push. 

5.  Person A: Pull. Etc. You now have a rhythm for working on the same file. 

\

**Setting up your repository\'s README file**

\

READMEs are written in markdown. See [this markdown cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for a guide on how to create headings, change the font, etc. 

\

Your README file needs to contain, at the least: 

1.  Your group members\' names

2.  Your species

3.  Have each group member write one paragraph about their favorite species (and commit/push/pull themselves). Remember to take turns. 

\

**Tips**

1.  Always save, commit, and push after working on a file

2.  Always pull before working on a file

3.  Give your commit messages descriptions that would help you if you needed to \"undo\" to go back to a previous version

4.  Communicate with your group when you plan to work on a file so two people are not working on the same file at once

**For those of you looking for extra challenges in this exercise**

\

Professional Challenge:Add your github information to your resume

\

Coding Challenge:  Add a photo of your species to your README file. You\'ll need to upload the photo to your repo, then you can use markdown syntax to call the photo.
