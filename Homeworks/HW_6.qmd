**Species Distribution Modeling Instructions**

\

Using the code from class, create 

1.  A current species distribution of your focal SSA species

2.  A future species distribution (70 years from now) of your focal SSA species 

\

Each data visualization of the model needs to include

-   A descriptive title

-   Axes labels

-   Clear legend 

-   Country and state borders

\

Each person needs to turn in

1.  An image of your current species distribution of your focal species

2.  An image of your future species distribution (70 years from now) of your focal species

3.  The .R file you used to create those images

**For those of you looking for extra challenges in this exercise**

\

Professional Challenge: Add a paragraph explaining this figure similar to what you would see in an SSA publication. E.g. **Figure 2:** Maxent Species Distribution Model of the Foothill Yellow-Legged Frog (Rana boylii). This species is mostly detected on coastal California however suitable habitat extends into the central valley. Occurrence data was downloaded from GBIF on 02/03/2023 (doi:) and available on GitHub (link).  

\

Coding Challenge: Transfer your .R  to a .md with instructions ready to be published on GitPages for others to learn how you did your model.
