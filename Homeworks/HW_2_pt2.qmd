**Resume Instructions and Hints**

\

Background: A resume is a list of knowledge, skills, and abilities for that particular job.  Or how will you be able to do the job advertised? Thus each resume is tailored to the job posting. So the template (or where stuff goes) of the resume is the same, but the content (or the stuff) changes for each job.

\

A resume is different from a CV.  A CV is the list of all your past achievements and deliverables. It is not tailored for a specific posting. The template and the content remain stable until achieving new deliverables such as a presentation, a publication, a new skill etc.

\

There are thousands of resume templates on the internet that can help you to get the position you desire; the challenge is finding the best resume template for your needs. Remember, the resume and the cover letter introduces you to potential employers and recruiters. But before you even talk with another human, an algorithm will approve your resume for human eyes to look at so make sure to use those keywords that are in the job announcement. Without those, you are unlikely to get an interview.

\

Your resume should be 1) easy to read 2) easy to find keywords related to the announcement 3) be honest about your skills and abilities and 4) represent who you are as a potential colleague

This is for computer science students but it gives some nice examples of how to make this work for recent grads without much experience (keep scrolling on it, so many ads <https://zety.com/blog/computer-science-resume>). Also CrashCourse has a good series on Youtube (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_4JBbeGsSE>). The example provided is a bit more CV like than resume like. See if you can improve on it. 

\

Instructions: Write a 1 page resume for an ecological job with data science skills/tools you think you would like. Highlight what skills you need but don\'t have for this type of work using a different color text. Resume should be no longer than a page (eek, we know).
