\

Using the species your group decided on, each person needs to turn in a .R file in which you

1.  Obtain data

    1.  From  GBIF

    2.  Set limit = 4000

2.  Clean data 

    1.  Remove duplicates

    2.  Remove where lat/long are NA

    3.  Remove points where occurrence status is not present

    4.  places that are not logical... be sure to justify with comments what points you determined were not logical ie. this species is endemic to Oregon so I can remove points in Australia

3.  Create a map of the occurrence points

    1.  Axes labels

    2.  Borders of countries and states

    3.  Descriptive title

\

Using comments, write a sentence or two describing what the occurrence points are.
